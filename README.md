  A RISK PREDICTION is any measure that is used to predict a personâ€™s risk of an event. Risk Prediction models have become an important part of Decision Making in quick and simple way. Nowadays there are many risks related to bank loans, especially for the banks so as to reduce their capital loss. The analysis of risks and assessment of default becomes crucial thereafter. Banks hold huge volumes of customer behavior related data from which they are unable to arrive at a judgement if an applicant can be defaulter or not.
  The use of AI in financial risk prediction is still in its nascence, but the combination of an exponential increase in the amount of available data and improving ML algorithms to digest these data has the potential to greatly impact the corporate field especially Banks. The use of ML in financial risk management can be illustrated through two interesting applications that are developing rapidly: Probability of Default, Early Warning Signals.
  This project discusses building a system for creating predictions that can be used in different scenarios. It focuses on predicting fraudulent transactions, which can reduce monetary loss and risk mitigation by building a web application. Using IBM Auto AI, we automate all of the tasks involved in building predictive models for different requirements from the dataset and predict the results.
